## Introduction

The Angular CRUD project with DummyAPI is a web application built using Angular, Angular Material, and an interceptor for global loading and error handling. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a set of dummy data provided by the DummyAPI.

The project aims to showcase how to implement basic CRUD functionality in Angular, create a responsive user interface using Angular Material components, and handle loading and error scenarios with the help of an interceptor.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
